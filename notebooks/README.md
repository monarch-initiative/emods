# Notebooks Directory

This directory is used for storing Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).

Only `.ipynb` files, this README.md, and the local .gitignore are tracked in Git; everything else is ignored.
If you need to add other notebook files, you will need to update the .gitignore in this folder.
See the local `.gitignore` in this folder for details.
